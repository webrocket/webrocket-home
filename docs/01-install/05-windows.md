## Installing on Windows

First public release (branch 0.3.x) has no support for Windows operating
system. However we do have Windows support in our plans... as long as we
get a machine with Windows installed. Of course we will appreciate your
help in making WebRocket available on Windows.

If you're not interested in helping us, then you watch watch how _Wallace 
and Gromit_ were building their own rocket instead...
